Capital Bikeshare Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning
## ðŸ“„ Capital Bikeshare â€“ Machine Learning II Report

This project focuses on demand forecasting for Capital Bikeshare stations using advanced regression models to predict daily bike pickups (PU_ct) and drop-offs (DO_ct) based on weather data.  
After evaluating models including Ridge, LASSO, ElasticNet, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP, **LASSO Regression** emerged as the most accurate and cost-efficient model.
